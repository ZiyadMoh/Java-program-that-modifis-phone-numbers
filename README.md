# Java-program-that-modifis-phone-numbers
Write a Java program that uses regular expressions to make a modified copyof a text file that contains, among other things, some   10-digit   phonenumbersthat   begin   with   +966.   The modified  copy  will  contain  the  same  text  but  in  every  phone number +966 must be replaced with 00966.Test your program well to make sure that it works correctly with all phone numbers regardless of their position in the file (beginning, middle,or end of  aline).  Also,  if  the  text  file contains  a  +  symbol  as  in  2+3=5 that has nothing to do with phone numbers, it should be copied as it is without any modifications.
